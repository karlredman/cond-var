<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>
<p>The POSIX standard for shared condition variables across processes is honored by most UNIX implementations except Linux. In order to provide uniform behavior of the condition variable mechanism a different solution for Linux had to be divined. The code examples provided here demonstrate one solution using signaling.</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Explanation:</h2>
<p>The included source code demonstrates the use of condition variables for multi-platform C programming. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/karlredman/cond-var/blob/master/docs/Condition_Variable_FAQ.md">Condition Variable FAQ</a> included with this distribution for more information on condition variables.</p>
<p>The enclosed programs should compile and run on most UNIX type platforms with GNU gcc compiler and linker tools. The use of preprocessor directives has been implemented for the purpose of showing the contrast between Linux and most other UNIX types of operating systems. Below is an explanation of what these differences are.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem:</h2>
<p>Linux does not provide a condition variable mechanism that is sharable between processes. Solaris and AIX, for instance, allow the use of a condition variable between two separate process -Linux doesn't.</p>
<p>While Linux does allow for condition variables between threads spawned from a single process, the kernel contains no code nor memory allocation for the condition variable mechanism. I realize this paragraph is redundant, but allot of people don't know this and deny it.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution:</h2>
<p>Use a signaling mechanism in place of a condition variable for Linux when shared condition variables are used, other UNIX type implementations will use condition variables.</p>
<p>Because of the excellent signaling infrastructure of Linux a POSIX style condition variable may be emulated. This emulated condition variable will perform a sigsuspend() to produce a wait effect and will make use of a SIGCONT (continue signal) to produce a wakeup effect.</p>
<p>The process that is waiting for the change of a variable in another process will suspend execution until it receives a SIGCONT from some other process. Below is an explanation of an example of this behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-example">The Example:</h2>
<p>The following explains the example code contained within this package from the Linux perspective only. Please see the reference section of the Condition Variable FAQ for information about how POSIX condition variables normally operate.</p>
<p>The program producer.c creates and attaches to a shared memory region that will be used by it and any of it's consumers. This shared memory region, masked by a structure, contains an array that the producer continuously updates and that the consumers continuously read from. Each time the producer updates an element of the array (data buffer) in shared memory, it sends a signal to consumer programs; thereby causing consumers that are waiting to continue.</p>
<p>In the main loop of the program, the producer first updates the data in the shared memory buffer then, under Linux, it sends a continue signal to each consumer which has registered itself with the producer program. A consumer is considered registered if it has updated the list of process IDs in shared memory and incremented the shared memory variable that tracks the total number of clients.</p>
<p>The code for the consumer process, consumer.c, is where all the action happens. After the consumer attaches the the shared memory region that was created by the producer it registers it self with the producer; taking the first available consumer &quot;slot&quot; in the process id list.</p>
<p>In the main loop of the consumer process we check to see if the consumer will be reading data from a position in the shared data buffer that is equal to the position where the producer will be witting data. If this occurs, we block the ability for other programs to interrupt the consumer process. Then we tell the consumer to suspend until a continue signal has been sent to it from another process, presumably the producer.</p>
<p>Once a continue (SIGCONT) signal is caught by the consumer, it replaces the signal mask that disallows interrupt signals with the original one. The consumer then continues operation by printing the data it read from the shared memory region, updates the position it will read from next, possibly sleeps for a little while (if desired), and finally repeats the main loop.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in order to use a sleep routine within the consumer process a special signal handler must be installed. This signal handler must block receipt of a continue signal which may be sent from the producer at any time. If SIGCONT were not blocked, the consumer process would wake up as soon as the producer process sent it a SIGCONT.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The result of all this is that you end up with one producer process and a bunch of consumer processes that only use as much processor time as is required. If you were to remove the condition variable mechanism here, a single consumer would continuously poll the producers data position, thereby causing the CPU to be used far more than is necessary.</p>
